# Online shop (index and search page) - Built time 17 hours

> This is a capstone/exam project for the [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org) module HTML/CSS. It is a Kids Wear website using HTML, CSS3/SCSS, Bootstrap, and Font awesome.

## Watch a video presentation of the project [here](https://www.loom.com/share/1ecb819a678e4b3f8681da87415597cf). The website is built using this [mockup](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX)

## To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Setup

Clone the project locally.

### Run tests
Run ``` npx html-validator-cli --quiet --file index.html ``` to run the validator over the ```index.html``` file.

The ```--quiet``` will only list ```errors```. If you also want to see the warnings use the ```--verbose``` flag instead.
As an alternative, you can also install the ```html5validator``` using ```pip```:

``` 
pip install --user html5validator
html5validator index.html
```

### Deployment

Install and run a live server plugin on you IDE/Text editor and run it from the root directory.

### Future improvements

Add a backend to the page
